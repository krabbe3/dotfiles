# DOTFILES OF LORENZ MOHR

This repo stores the dotfiles of Lorenz Mohr\
WIP

## Installation

- clone the repo
    - git clone --recurse-submodules
- then softlink all dotfiles by executing the script ./setup_dotfiles.sh

## Requirements

- tested for neovim version 0.10.4, 0.11.5 and 0.11.6
- at some point I have to make a shift towards 0.11.5+
    - right now, this is done by using a stale branch for treesitter
    - and some deprecated lspconfig configuration
    - needs to be changed

## Config Files
- [Neovim](nvim/README.md)
